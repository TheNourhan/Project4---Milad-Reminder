        <h1>Milad Reminder</h1>
        <p>Milad sometimes wakes up late, and he would like to send an automated message to the office, to inform them that he will be late.
            This system needs to work for 20 days, and keep in mind that he does not work on weekends (sat, sun), and some special off-days.</p>
